Rugby is a popular sport in England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and France. In recent years Italy has become a great rugby nation.
It competes with England, Wales, Scotland, France, and Ireland at the Six Nations Championship. Itâ€™s an annual rugby competition. All these teams are dreaming of Grand Slam.
The Grand Slam means to win all the matches of the competition.
But now in addition to the Six Nations Championship, the Rugby World Cup takes place this year. It is the only time Northern hemisphere teams meet teams from the Southern hemisphere in a great competition.
Apart from the UK the spirit of rugby is very popular in Australia and New Zealand. That is why the teams of the southern hemisphere are New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. 
They can also add Argentina which is also good at rugby very well.
Rugby is associated with three main values: respect, team spirit and courage. It can also be said that rugby fans behave very well before, 
during and after matches. There are no cases of violence in the grandstands. And if you have your favorite rugby team, you can safely go to the stadium, watch the World Cup and support your team.
